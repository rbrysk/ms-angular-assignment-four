                <li>Create three new components: GameControl, Odd, Even</li>
                <li>
                    The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and
                    stop the game
                </li>
                <li>
                    When starting the game, an event (holding an incrementing
                    number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
                </li>
                <li>
                    The event should be listenable from outside the component
                </li>
                <li>
                    When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted
                    (clearInterval(ref))
                </li>
                <li>
                    A new Odd component should get created for every odd number
                    emitted, the same should happen for the Even component (on
                    even numbers)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two
                    components
                </li>
                <li>
                    Style the elements (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text
                    differently in both components
                </li>
            </ol>
